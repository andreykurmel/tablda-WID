<div id="basic_wind_speed">
    <h4><b>Wind Speed Basis</b></h4>

    <p>Historically, wind speeds have been reported with a variety of averaging times (such as fastest mile, 3-second gust, 1-minute and mean hourly)</p>

    <p>"3-second gust" is the highest sustained gust over a 3-second period having a probability of being exceeded per year of 1 in 50 (ASCE 7-05). 3-sec gust wind speeds introduced in ASCE 7-95 to replace fastest-mile wind speeds. Basic wind speeds didnâ€™t changed at all from ASCE 7-98 through ASCE 7-05. 3-sec gust wind speed allows design to accomodate instantaneous loads.</p>

    <p>The basis for wind design was</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>service-level, fastest mile windspeeds in ASCE 7-93,</li>
        <li>service-level, 3-second gust windspeeds in ASCE 7-02 and 7-05 (TIA-222-G) and</li>
        <li>strength-level, 3-second gust windspeeds in ASCE 7-10.</li>

        <p>Previous versions of ASCE 7 used a 50-year return wind speed map and relied on additional design factors to increase wind loads according to the reliability requirements of a structure. This resulted in structures being able to survive wind speeds of much higher return periods. The new wind maps in ASCE 7 -10 now include these design factors and now represent a much higher return period wind speed. A wind map is provided for each classification of structure. No additional factors have to be considered based on the classification of a structure when these wind speeds are used to calculate wind loads. Windspeeds are also provided for serviceability purposes for 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year return periods when using ASCE 7-10.</p>

        <li>for design referencing purpose, service-level wind speed (V_asd, allowable stress design wind speed) is sometimes called nominal wind speed and strength-level wind speed ultimate wind speed or survival wind speed (V_ult, ultimate design wind speed). The relationship between them are V_asd = V_ult*sqrt(0.6).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The 2006 International Building Code (IBC 2006), Section 1609.3.1 provides the following conversion equation between 3-second gust wind speed (V_3s) and fastest mile wind speed (V_fm):</p> 
    <p>V_fm = (V_3s - 10.5) / 1.05.</p>

    <p class="knowledge_note">Exposure categories are used to adjust wind loading based on the type of terrain surrounding a site. Reduced wind loads are associated with rougher terrains that tend to slow the wind down. Three exposure categories have been defined based on terrain roughness. Wind loading is increased as the exposure designation changes from Exposure B (roughest terrain) to Exposure D (smoothest terrain).</p>     

    <p><b>1. Exposure B:</b></p> 
    <p class="knowledge_code">Urban and suburban areas, wooded areas, or other terrain with numerous closely spaced obstructions having the size of single-family dwellings or larger.</p>
